  <h1>Joao Jeronimo</h1>
  <p>I am a PhD researcher in Economics with a strong foundation in competition, labour economics, econometrics, and applied data analysis. My research focuses on the nature of labour market (im)perfect competition, the instruments we use to measure these outcomes and how they are shaped by policy and institutions. I bring hands-on experience with Python, R, and Stata to conduct econometric modeling and efficient analysis using large datasets (50M+ observations).</p>
  <p>On this page, I share ideas about my work in economics, as well as other (adjacent) areas of interest to me - those might include mathematics, statistics and machine learning. You can also find more information about my current and past <a href="/research/">research</a>, and my <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.</p>
