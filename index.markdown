  <h1>Joao Jeronimo</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! I am a PhD researcher in Economics with a strong background in competition and labour economics, econometrics, and applied data analysis. My research explores how imperfect competition shapes labour markets, how we measure these forces empirically, and how policy and institutions influence their outcomes.
</p>
  <p>I work extensively with large-scale datasets (50M+ observations), using Python, R, and Stata to build econometric models and extract insight from complex data.
</p>
  <p>On this site, I share ideas from my research in economics, along with thoughts on closely related interests such as mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. You’ll also find details about my current and past <a href="/research/">research</a>, as well as my <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.</p>
