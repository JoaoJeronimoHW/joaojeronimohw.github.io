  <h1>Joao Jeronimo</h1>
  <p>I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Heriot-Watt University with a strong foundation in labor economics, econometrics, and applied data analysis. My research explores wage dynamics and labor market behavior using advanced statistical techniques and matched employer-employee datasets. I bring hands-on experience with tools like Python, R, and Stata to conduct rigorous econometric modeling, causal inference, and data-driven insights.</p>
  <p>In this corner of the internet I share ideas about my work in economics, as well as other (adjacent) areas of interest to me - those might include mathematics, statistics and machine learning. In the future, I plan on adding a section to this website devoted to "non-academic" interests, including history, outdoors camping and bushcraft, sci-fi/fantasy literature (I share George Martin's view that there shouldn't be a distinction made between the two) and, most importantly, my dog, Artie.</p>
