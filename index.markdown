    <h1>Joao Jeronimo</h1>
    <p>I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at Heriot-Watt University with a strong foundation in labor economics, econometrics, and applied data analysis. My research explores wage dynamics and labor market behavior using advanced statistical techniques and matched employer-employee datasets. I bring hands-on experience with tools like Python, R, and Stata to conduct rigorous econometric modeling, causal inference, and data-driven insights.</p>
